1. 
(MANDATORY AND IMPORTANT TASK) 
http://162.55.220.72:5005/user_info_2
It is necessary to test the API of this endpoint to validate the input parameters. 
The essence of the task: 
To check the validations of each field supplied to the endpoint for possible values. 
We will CONDITIONALLY assume that a negative check should return any status BUT NOT 200! 
Your task is to write test cases in postman in such a way that one negative check is one request,
positive checks can be combined into 1. 
Your task is to test based on the requirements for all possible aspects. In each request, 
test ONLY FOR STATUS CODE (200 - positive value, not 200 - negative). 
P.S. THE TASK DOES NOT IMPLIED THAT THE ENDPOINT WORKS ACCORDING TO THE WRITTEN REQUIREMENTS. 
WE LEARN TO WRITE TESTS FOR API! Requirements:
   1) Name: 3-40 characters inclusive, prefix and postfix spaces are prohibited. The field is required
   2) Age: only integers in the range 18-120 inclusive. The field is required
   3) Salary: only whole numbers in the range 1-1000000 inclusive. The field is required
Convert task 1 so that you submit the parameters via a CSV file.
You will have exactly 1 query in the collection, which will be repeated as many times as there are rows in the CSV file. 
Also, a function should be written in the tests that checks the validity of the incoming data, 
and depending on this, checks for a status of 200 or NOT 200.

Convert items 12-13-14 (salary from request and response are equal) in such a way that the check is performed in a cycle, 
in which there will be only ONE test. The test name should change depending on the value in Salary

3. 
http://162.55.220.72:5005/object_info_3
Convert tasks 5-7 (compare identical fields in the request and response) 
in such a way that it was done IN ONE TEST (all 3 fields at once) WITHOUT CYCLES! (deep object comparison)

 1)     Convert tasks 8 - 13 (check that json has the required parameter) in this way,
        so that all checks are done in a cycle (1 check in a cycle, which includes the necessary parameters).
        The name of the test should be modified based on the submitted data. ( ${} or some other way)

 2)**   Convert tasks 14 - 18 (check that the parameter is equal to salary multiplied by the coefficient) in such a way that
        so that all checks are done in a cycle (1 check in a cycle, which includes the necessary parameters).
        The name of the test should be modified based on the submitted data. ( ${} or some other way)

  3)*** Convert the tasks 1 and 2 described above for this endpoint to ONE CYCLE,
        where BOTH tests will take place.
